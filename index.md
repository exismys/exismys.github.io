## My fellow sentient beings!

Well, my name is Ritesh Patel. I'm from a small village near Varanasi.

My primary interest lies in understanding the nature of existence (although I'm unsure if we can ever...), and so for how lost I am, I go wandering around exploring
- Physics/Math
- Programming
- Chess
- Movies and TV shows (I love movies)
- Lots of other things

## Some projects I have worked on:

- Sorting Algorithm Visualizer: [Live](https://exismyssav.netlify.app/) - [GitHub](https://github.com/exismys/SortingAlgorithmVisualizer)

## My favorite books
1. Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir
2. Ender's Game by Orson S. Card
3. Recursion by Blake Crouch

## My favorite movies
1. Arrival
2. Contact
3. Fight Club
4. And so many others (I have watched too many)
