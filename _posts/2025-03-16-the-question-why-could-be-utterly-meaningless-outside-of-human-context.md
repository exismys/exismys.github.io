title: The Question "Why" could be Utterly Meaningless Out of Human Context

<p>Wondering about the nature of reality and very idea of the existence itself has become nothing less than a sort of hobby. I have come to the conclusion that I might never unravel the mystery the existence is. For instance, consider the question: Why does something exist? or Why is there something instead of nothing?</p>

<p>So now, how does the world begin? It comes into existence somehow. How...? Why...? Is the question "why" even valid? Could it be that the question "why" is just a human construct resulting from our linear cause and effect based language?
</p>

<p>Why implies a purpose for existence, the implication that there has to be a purpose for something to exist. That could be completely non-sensical outside of human perview. The "why" is what brings about the idea of intelligent design, i.e. if there is purpose, someone must have assigned that purpose, implying the existence of consciousness before non-existence. Following that logic, there must be something existing before the existence, a contradiction. This does not make sense. The question of why and the idea of "purpose" seem meaningless.</p>
