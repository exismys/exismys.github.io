        <p>I will leave this for the greats, in their own words:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"You are something the whole universe is doing in the same way that a wave is something that the whole ocean is doing."</p>
          <cite>- Alan Watts</cite>
        </blockquote>
        <p>Some more from the same guy:</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"The real, deep down you is the whole universe."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"Try and imagine what it will be like to go to sleep and never wake up."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <blockquote>
          <p>"What was it like to wake up after having never gone to sleep? That was when you were born."</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>You might have guessed by now that I am that quote guy and I certainly am! Words affect me as much as the silence. If I have to potray myself on an internet forum, this presentation will speak more about me than what I might say.</p>
