            <div class="home-content">
                <p>Well, my name is Ritesh Patel. I'm from a small village near Varanasi.</p>
                <p>My primary interest lies in understanding the nature of existence (although I'm unsure if we can ever...), and so for how lost I am, I go wandering around exploring:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Physics/Math</li>
                    <li> Programming</li>
                    <li> Chess</li>
                    <li> Movies and TV shows (I love movies)</li>
                    <li> Lots of other things</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Some projects I have worked on:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> Sorting Algorithm Visualizer: <a href="https://exismyssav.netlify.app/" target="_blank">Live</a> - <a href="https://github.com/exismys/SortingAlgorithmVisualizer" target="_blank">GitHub</a></li>
                </ul>

                <h2>My favorite books</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> Project Hail Mary by Andy Weir</li>
                    <li> Ender's Game by Orson S. Card</li>
                    <li> Recursion by Blake Crouch</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>My favorite movies</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li> Arrival</li>
                    <li> Contact</li>
                    <li> Fight Club</li>
                    <li> And so many others (I have watched too many)</li>
                </ol>

            <p>My purpose in writing these blogs is not to teach anyone anything. It is to learn things. As people have said, the best way to understand something is to explain it in simple and clear words.</p>
            <p>So, here I am explaining things to no one, and perhaps I can look back at them as a reference. Feedback is welcome.</p>
